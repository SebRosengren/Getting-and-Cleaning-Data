The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
    
The run_analysis.R script performs the following steps to clean the data:
1. Read X_train.txt, y_train.txt and subject_train.txt from the "./data/train" folder and store them in TrainData, TrainLabel and TrainSubject.
2. Read X_test.txt, y_test.txt and subject_test.txt from the "./data/test" folder and store them in TestData, TestLabel and Testsubject.
3. Concatenate TestData to TrainData to generating a data frame (dims. 10299x561), called "JoinData". Concatenate TestLabel to TrainLabel generating a data frame (dims. 10299x1), "JoinLabel". Concatenate TestSubject to TrainSubject generatin a data frame (dims. 10299x1), "JoinSubject".
4. Read the features.txt file from the "/data" folder and store the data in a variable called features. Then extract the measurements mean and standard deviation. This results list of indicies 66 values long. We get a subset of JoinData with the 66 corresponding columns.
5. Edit the column names of the subset removing the "()" and "-" symbols in the names, then capitalise the first letter of "mean" and "std".
6. Read the activity_labels.txt file from the "./data" folder and store the data in a variable called activity.
7. Clean the activity names in the second column of activity. First change all names to lower case and remove the underscores in the names and capitalise the letter after the underscore.
8. Change the values of JoinLabel according to the activity data frame.
9. Combine JoinSubject, JoinLabel and JoinData by column to get a new data frame(dims. 10299x68), "CleanedData". Rename the first two columns, "subject" and "activity".
10. Write CleanedData to a text file "merged_data.txt"
11. Finally, create a second independent tidy data set with the means of each measurement for activity and subject and write the result out to "tidy_dataset.txt".
